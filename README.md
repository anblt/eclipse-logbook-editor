# LogBookEditor

### Motivation

- This eclipse-based editor is a case-study for the implementation of an editor with syntax-highlighting, outline and preference dialog
- It's main purpose is help me in maintaining the releasenotes for my projects. It's rough around the edges right now but it works.
- But one can also use it …
  - … to maintain your project history/releasenotes
  - … to denote project milestones
  - … to denote future events, reminders …
  - … and TODOs that have to be done meeting certain deadlines
